# SVC(Scratch Version Control)  
SVC is a project that can help you to control your Scratch project's version.It's not has finish,that mean I'm still make it.  
There are something that I think you would like to see.  
***  
# For Winnet  
I think you saw the LICENSE of GPL.So you can use some of these code,but remember tell me or Magic Stuidio.  
Well,they are your enemy not mean you can break the LICENSE espacially on Github that is so important in OPEN SOURCE.  
This is a warning for you,well.  
***  
# Just about how to use it  
emm...:)  
## exit  
exit,type exit to quit the console of SVC,just like cmd.  
## cd  
cd,after the path,like`cd C:\`,change the work path.  
## init  
DON'T USE THAT.
